# QTLmethods

This repository was established to look into QTL methods.  Specifically, I'm interested in multivariate linear mixed models for QTL analyses.  I want to account for population stratification as well as model multiple phenotypes at the same time.  

I have 3 folders so far:

1. Papers: papers I found interesting and helpful when looking into what method to use

2. Presentations: presentations I've put together looking into methods

3. qtl2: code of me trying out qtl2 package in R
